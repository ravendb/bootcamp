# RavenDB Bootcamp

So you&#39;ve decided you want to learn [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/ "RavenDB is the premier NoSQL database for .NET"). That&#39;s great! This Bootcamp is a free, self-directed learning course, designed specifically for this purpose.

This bootcamp is up-to-date with RavenDB 4.

In just three units you will learn how to use RavenDB to create fully-functional, real-world programs with NoSQL Databases. If you are unfamiliar with NoSQL, don&#39;t worry, we will provide you with all the information you need.

We suggest you go through at least one lesson per day, but you can choose your own pace.

## What will you learn?

The RavenDB Bootcamp will teach you how to use RavenDB - a powerful NoSQL database engine – *Safe by Default, Optimized for Efficiency* – that combines the best of two worlds: relational and document–oriented databases.

You will see how easy it is to store and query data using RavenDB and how fast you can produce valuable results.

After you complete this bootcamp, not only will you be confident to store your data using NoSQL, database work will actually become fun.

### Unit 1 - Fundamentals

In Unit 1, you will learn the fundamentals of RavenDB.

First, you will learn how to install and make it work on your machine. As you will see, RavenDB makes starting easy by providing an embedded sample database – if you think "Northwind", you are right! – which you can use for your learning process with minimal effort. Then, you will write some code to connect to the database and quickly store, load, modify and delete documents.

* [Lesson 1: Getting Started](src/Unit-1/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Let's code](src/Unit-1/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Basics of DocumentStore](src/Unit-1/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Loading Documents](src/Unit-1/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: Querying fundamentals in the C# side](src/Unit-1/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Storing, modifying and deleting documents](src/Unit-1/lesson6)

### Unit 2 - Beyond the basics

In Unit 2, you are going to learn intermediate RavenDB features. You will see how fast RavenDB is and understand why.

You will learn that you can easily perform very complex queries using only RavenDB (without additional tools). For example, you will learn what Map-Reduce is and when to use it to extract more value from your data.

* [Lesson 1: Getting started with indexes](src/Unit-2/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Creating an index and querying it](src/Unit-2/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Multi-map indexes](src/Unit-2/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Mapping(, filtering) and reducing](src/Unit-2/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: The powerful LoadDocument server-side function](src/Unit-2/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Goodbye Transformers, Welcome Server-side Projections](src/Unit-2/lesson6)
* [Lesson 7: Statistics and some words about stale indexes!](src/Unit-2/lesson7)

### Unit 3 - Almost advanced!

In Unit 3, you will learn some advanced RavenDB features.

You don’t need to know these features in your daily work, but you can use this knowledge to build powerful solutions, obtain better performance, improve safety or create truly reactive user interfaces.

* [Lesson 1: Document Metadata](src/Unit-3/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Getting started with Operations and Commands!](src/Unit-3/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Performing batch operations](src/Unit-3/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: I am going through changes ...](src/Unit-3/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: Data Subscriptions - I would like to be notified when happens, pls](src/Unit-3/lesson5)

[Let's begin!](src/Unit-1/lesson1)

That’s it. Enjoy the RavenDB bootcamp and feel free to share your feedback with us.
